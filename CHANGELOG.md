# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [v0.2.3] - 2023-01-25

### Added

- Check to ensure that a topic URL resolves on discourse after allowing for any
  redirects.

## Changed

- URL checks are now after allowing for any discourse redirects rather than
  before letting topic URLs pass that do not include the slug or do not include
  the topic id as long as the URL after redirects is valid.
- The check for whether the current branch clashes with the branch being created
  has been removed. This is no longer required because the migration branch is
  now from the default branch and there is an existing check that looks for any
  clashes with existing branches.
- The action no longer goes back to detached head mode after completing git
  operations since the action now runs in a temporary directory meaning that no
  changes persist beyond the action completing.

### Fixed

- Bug where the action required environment variables that aren't available on
  all supported triggers.

## [v0.2.2] - 2023-01-23

### Fixed

- Name clashes during migration for checkouts when a file or directory has the
  same name as the branch being checked out

### Changed

- The action now operates in a temporary directory that is a copy of the
  directory the action was called on. Using a temporary directory ensures that
  any operations of the action, such as git operations, do not change the state
  of the files and directories any following steps receive.

## [v0.2.1] - 2023-01-20

### Fixed

- Migration now correctly handles that the git checkout on GitHub actions runs
  in detached head mode, the migration failed before due to not being able to
  create a new branch from detached head mode
- Only files in the `docs` directory are now added to the migration PR
- The migration PR is now created with a branch from the default branch merging
  back into the default branch, previously the branch was from the branch the
  action was running on back into that branch

## [v0.2.0] - 2023-01-13

### Added

- Topics are now created unlisted on discourse
- Runs on a charm with existing documentation and without the `docs` directory
  now results in a PR being created to migrate the docs to the repository

## [v0.1.1] - 2022-12-13

### Fixed

- Resolve bug where the presence of a topic on the server was not checked

### Fixed

- Allow redirects for topic retrieval which is useful if the slug is
  incorrectly or not defined

## [v0.1.0] - 2022-12-07

### Added

- Copying files from source to discourse
- Dry run mode to see changes that would occur without executing them
- Option to skip deleting topics from discourse
