    There are two types of conflicts. The first is where the local content is different to what is

    is making changes to the same page.

    The second type of conflict is a logical conflict which arises out of that there are at least
    some changes on the server that have not been merged into git yet and the branch is proposing
    to make changes to the documentation as well. This means that there could be changes made on
    the server which logically conflict with proposed changes in the PR. These conflicts can be
    supppressed using the discourse-ahead-ok tag on the commit that the action is running on.
